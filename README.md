# textgrid_editor.py

Different from the previous Python package for TextGrid, this project uses the DataFrame of pandas to store the Interval and Point data of TextGrid. And it provides a flexible API for converting between TextGrids and pandas DataFrames. It will also support  TextGrid editing, that is, cropping/extending and concatenating TextGrids.
