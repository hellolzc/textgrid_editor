# textgrid_editor.py

Different from the previous Python package for TextGrid, this project uses the DataFrame of pandas to store the Interval and Point data of TextGrid. And it provides a flexible API for converting between TextGrids and pandas DataFrames. In the future, it will also support editing TextGrid, that is, cropping and concatenating TextGrid.
